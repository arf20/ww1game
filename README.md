# ww1game
Generic WW1 game (?)

This is my first SDL2 2D "game".

Language will be, of course, C++ version 17, for \<filesystem>.

The game engine is going to be completely separate from the game content, just like Quake.
All the assets will be in individual PNG files, and the maps will be described by a character matrix driven text file format.

Dependencies will be SDL2, SDL2_image and probably GL.
